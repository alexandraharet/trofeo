# trofeo
Website for the annual running race 'Trofeo Verduci' taking place in Motta san Giovanni, Italy.

Project details:
Website was built as a first project using Bootstrap 3. It also incorporates a couple of other libraries (ScrollMagic and ScrollSpy) to help create some of the effects you see on pages (ScrollSpy is used on the homepage when navigating between hash-links; ScrollMagic is created to animate the 'latest news' and rasegna stampa' boxes on the homepage, as well as the timeline on the Storia del Trofeo page).

Website was built 'desktop first', which prompted some issues with offsets in triggering scroll events (looked ok on desktop, not on on mobile).

JavaScript & jQuery were further used to:
- change the alignment and display of the timeline on desktop / small devices; 
- add overlays to some boxes & images (see Interviste pages, the top profile pics, as well as rassegna stampa, on click)
- to dynamically add place numbers on the table of winners (Albo D'Oro page).
